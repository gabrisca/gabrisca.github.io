In Study 1, positive country stereotypes (warmth, competence) mitigate punitive intent by diminishing agonistic emotions (contempt, anger, and disgust). Study 2 demonstrates that perceived similarity with a wrongdoing company’s country of origin moderates the indirect effects of country stereotypes on emotion-driven punitive intent. Compensatory effects between country stereotypes and perceived country similarity emerge; with greater (lower) perceived country similarity, the indirect effects of country stereotypes on emotion-driven punitive intent are weaker (stronger). The results provide companies with relevant insights into (1) why consumers emotionally react as they do to wrongdoing companies of different nationalities and (2) how to counterbalance negative effects of company misconduct by harmonizing elements of countries’ warmth, competence, and perceived country similarity in branding and communication content.","keywords":[{"tag":"consumer condemning emotions"},{"tag":"consumer retaliatory intent"},{"tag":"corporate crisis"},{"tag":"corporate greed"},{"tag":"country stereotypes"}],"conf":null,"activities":null,"city":null,"state":null,"nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ibusrev.2022.101995"},{"id":2,"category":"article","ranking":"","authors":[{"name":"C.

Therefore, preventing children from becoming overweight is a major public health challenge. Here, we used a mixed-method research approach – including a quasi-experimental design and three surveys – to create a formative evaluation of a social marketing campaign on healthy nutrition and lifestyle in Italian primary school children. The social marketing campaign was organized around the 4 Ps of the marketing mix (product: the educational activities; place: the involved schools and supermarkets; promotion: the in-person and technology-based communication; and price: hours spent by the targeted children in fulfilling the educational activities). The campaign involved primary-school children across four Italian cities. The findings suggest that social marketing education campaigns can be effective tools to improve children’s knowledge about healthy food and lifestyle, reduce their sedentary behavior, and increase their consumption of healthy food. Also, increasing children’s acceptance of healthful nourishment is a valuable tool to improve the dietary habits of the entire family. With relation to the educational program assessment method, this study can inform societal interventions especially those involving children through the integration of different qualitative and quantitative research methods, which collect data from different subjects and perspectives.","keywords":[{"tag":"social marketing education campaign"},{"tag":"children’s nutrition and lifestyle"},{"tag":"mixed-method research approach"},{"tag":"italy"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2021.101965"},{"id":3,"category":"article","ranking":"cnrs: 2, fnege: 2","authors":[{"name":"C.

This green-feminine stereotype has been accused of deterring men from buying green products to protect their gender identity. Here, we investigate whether men can benefit from this green-feminine stereotype, beyond the status effect of green conspicuous consumption. We propose that green consumption can act as a signal of altruism and high commitment both as a partner and as a father. Based on evidence showing that these traits are sought in a long-term partner, we predict that men can increase their value as long-term mates by engaging in green consumption. We also investigate whether men involved in a long-term mating relationship are indeed eco-friendlier, testing the novel hypothesis that green consumption is an honest signal of commitment. Finally, we specify the type of commitment that is associated with men\'s green consumption. Across six studies, our findings suggest that green consumption is an honest signal of men\'s long-term mating value and that it is a more reliable sign of partner commitment than of father commitment. We discuss how companies and governments can use these findings to increase green consumption among men.","keywords":[{"tag":"green consumption"},{"tag":"stereotype"},{"tag":"environment"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1002/mar.21321"},{"id":5,"category":"article","ranking":"fnege: 3","authors":[{"name":"I.

This study presents a conceptual model that considers three relevant altruistic, ecological antecedents of eco-friendly product adoption (environmental beliefs, environmental concern, and smart home objects\' perceived usefulness for the environment) and assesses their influence on the intention to purchase smart home objects.

Structural equation modeling is applied to data from a sample of 641 French respondents.

By means of two qualitative studies and a quantitative survey with 1325 Belgian participants, early adopter consumer segments of Spirulina-enhanced food are identified (sporting individuals, vegetarians and foodies), and compared with a contrast group (life enjoyers). The motivational drivers and barriers to the adoption of eco-friendly Spirulina-enhanced food across the identified consumer segments is assessed.

Study 1 (n=883) analyzes the psychological mechanisms through which perceived COO competence and warmth differently affect blame attributions and evaluative responses. Study 2 (n=1,640) replicates Study 1’s findings, and it also investigates how consumer ethnocentrism, animosity toward a country, and product category characteristics moderate the hypothesized COO’s effects. COO competence leads to more favorable attitudes toward the involved company’s products. This effect increases when the company sells high-involvement or utilitarian products. COO warmth leads to more favorable attitudes toward the involved company’s products directly as well as indirectly by diminishing blame attributions. These effects increase when consumers are highly ethnocentric, or the animosity toward a foreign country is high. This paper frames the investigation of COO stereotypes in a new theoretical and empirical setting, specifically, a product-harm crisis. It demonstrates that consumers differently evaluate a potential wrongdoing company and its harmful products in a product-harm crisis based on their perceptions of a company’s COO competence and warmth. Finally, it defines the moderating effects of individual, consumer-country-related and product characteristics on the hypothesized COO effects.","keywords":[{"tag":"competence"},{"tag":"country-of-origin"},{"tag":"warmth"},{"tag":"product-harm crisis"},{"tag":"national stereotypes"},{"tag":"survey-based quasi-experimental researc"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1108/IMR-06-2016-0122"},{"id":9,"category":"article","ranking":"cnrs: 1","authors":[{"name":"C.

The results show that perceived country-of-origin warmth diminishes consumers’ perceptions of internal locus, stability, and controllability of the food incident, thus decreasing consumers’ attributions of blame toward the faulty brand. Perceived competence increases consumers’ perceptions of the controllability of the harmful behavior which leads to higher attributions of blame. Higher blame attribution leads to lower intentions to buy the brand in the future.

The second contribution of this study is that it develops insight into the specific antecedents of eco-friendly products purchasing for green and non-green consumers to assess potential similarities and differences in eco-friendly products purchasing process, the hypothesized antecedents, their impact on eco-friendly products purchase intention and behavior, and the intention–behavior relation.","keywords":[{"tag":"consumer behaviour"}],"conf":null,"activities":null,"city":null,"state":null,"nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/s10551-014-2425-z"},{"id":18,"category":"article","ranking":null,"authors":[{"name":"C.

Secondly, to explore which \'negative\' beliefs prevent these consumers from purchasing green goods and, finally, to deepen which is the role played by such antecedents within the purchase decision process. A better knowledge of green purchase decision process may help firms selling green products to tailor marketing strategies and, thus, reduce the intention-behaviour gap faced by green consumers.

With a focus on pure players’ websites, the aim of our study is to analyze the main determinants of users’ e-brand attitudes. In doing so, our study considers three key variables relating to e-brand attitudes: interactivity, personalization and e-trust. A quantitative empirical study was conducted, and data were analyzed using structural equation modeling. The results show that the key determinants of user attitudes toward e-brands are interactivity (indirect) and personalization (direct). To a lesser extent, e-trust is a factor that has a significant effect on e-brand attitudes. Furthermore, it is the interrelationships among these constructs that are of particular interest. This study could serve both as a theoretical reference point for future research and as a managerial tool for the integrated evaluation of the multidimensional relationships among e-brand attitude key drivers.","keywords":[{"tag":"e-brand attitude"},{"tag":"interactivity"},{"tag":"personalization"},{"tag":"e-trust"},{"tag":"structural equation modeling"}],"conf":null,"activities":null,"city":null,"state":null,"nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1057/bm.2011.59"},{"id":21,"category":"article","ranking":null,"authors":[{"name":"A.

Consequently, consumers perceive them as too complex (cognitive gap), do not recognize their value and, at last, do not buy them. In order to let people overcome this cognitive gap, firms develop marketing communication as well as brand architecture strategies. The purpose of the paper is to find out the most effective brand architecture strategy that minimizes consumers’ cognitive gap about technology driven and convergent product offerings. Due to the distinct lack of previous studies on the topic, this paper has an explorative approach fulfilled by a theoretical analysis.

Consumers and companies are not immune to these incidents. However, there is a paucity of studies that examine consumer responses toward food companies involved in food safety scandals. This chapter attempts to address these issues. First, it provides theoretical bases for the psychological mechanisms through which consumers form judgments of blame toward food brands involved in food safety scandals. Second, it clarifies how attributions of blame negatively affect relevant consumer non-behavioural responses (emotions and attitude) and behavioural responses (purchase intention, word-of-mouth, and boycott) toward faulty food brands. Third, it provides a literature review of the most relevant consumer-related, brand-related, and context-related variables, which may influence the psychological mechanisms of blame attribution, and subsequent non-behavioural and behavioural responses, in the context of a food safety incident.","keywords":[{"tag":"food safety scandals"},{"tag":"food-harm crises"},{"tag":"attribution of blame"},{"tag":"negative emotions"},{"tag":"consumer punitive actions"}],"conf":null,"activities":null,"city":null,"state":null,"nation":null,"flag":null,"date":null,"link":"https://www.universitypressscholarship.com/view/10.1332/policypress/9781447336013.001.0001/upso-9781447336013-chapter-024"},{"id":3,"category":"chapter","ranking":null,"authors":[{"name":"C.

GSI is also assumed to have a direct effect on ATT. The attitude towards the electric car then determines the intention to adopt it. The model is empirically tested in three culturally different European countries: Denmark, Belgium and Italy. Results show that the three countries differ in the way they develop positive attitudes and intentions towards the electric car on the basis of their green self-identity. In Denmark, GSI strongly and directly leads to positive attitudes. In Belgium, ATT is mainly formed through the development of a strong EC. In Italy, MO plays a dominant role in the development of positive attitudes.

Findings show that the higher the level of D-S interaction, the greater the cooperation between consumers and firms. When the degree of D-S interaction is low, consumers act as \'ethically-responsible purchasers\', and the mainstream market is adapted to consumers ethical needs. When the degree of D-S interaction is high, consumers become co-producers of the new venture, and the market is substantially transformed (domesticated).","keywords":[{"tag":"business Model"},{"tag":"ethical consumption"},{"tag":"multiple case study"}],"conf":null,"activities":null,"city":null,"state":null,"nation":null,"flag":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1007/978-3-030-34261-6_15"}],"conferences":[{"id":1,"category":"conference","ranking":null,"authors":[{"name":"C.
