Therefore, preventing children from becoming overweight is a major public health challenge. Here, we used a mixed-method research approach – including a quasi-experimental design and three surveys – to create a formative evaluation of a social marketing campaign on healthy nutrition and lifestyle in Italian primary school children. The social marketing campaign was organized around the 4 Ps of the marketing mix (product: the educational activities; place: the involved schools and supermarkets; promotion: the in-person and technology-based communication; and price: hours spent by the targeted children in fulfilling the educational activities). The campaign involved primary-school children across four Italian cities. The findings suggest that social marketing education campaigns can be effective tools to improve children’s knowledge about healthy food and lifestyle, reduce their sedentary behavior, and increase their consumption of healthy food. Also, increasing children’s acceptance of healthful nourishment is a valuable tool to improve the dietary habits of the entire family. With relation to the educational program assessment method, this study can inform societal interventions especially those involving children through the integration of different qualitative and quantitative research methods, which collect data from different subjects and perspectives.","keywords":[{"tag":"social marketing education campaign"},{"tag":"children’s nutrition and lifestyle"},{"tag":"mixed-method research approach"},{"tag":"italy"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.evalprogplan.2021.101965"},{"id":3,"category":"article","ranking":"cnrs: 2, fnege: 2","authors":[{"name":"C.

We propose that green consumption can act as a signal of altruism and high commitment both as a partner and as a father. Based on evidence showing that these traits are sought in a long-term partner, we predict that men can increase their value as long-term mates by engaging in green consumption. We also investigate whether men involved in a long-term mating relationship are indeed eco-friendlier, testing the novel hypothesis that green consumption is an honest signal of commitment. Finally, we specify the type of commitment that is associated with men\'s green consumption. Across six studies, our findings suggest that green consumption is an honest signal of men\'s long-term mating value and that it is a more reliable sign of partner commitment than of father commitment.

The results show that the more ecotourism is perceived to have a stronger responsible, emotional and, to a certain extent active, personality than a respondent’s personality, the more ecotourism is considered by that person as congruent with the actual, ideal and/or social self. In turn, actual, ideal and social self-ecotourism congruity increase the willingness to pay more for ecotourism.

Although smart home objects have also been acknowledged to promote environmental sustainability, investigation of the influence of altruistic and ecological motivational variables on consumers\' willingness to purchase these products has been limited. This study presents a conceptual model that considers three relevant altruistic, ecological antecedents of eco-friendly product adoption (environmental beliefs, environmental concern, and smart home objects\' perceived usefulness for the environment) and assesses their influence on the intention to purchase smart home objects. Furthermore, it uncovers the moderating role of the two dimensions of materialism (success and happiness) and hypothesizes that they moderate the relationship between environmental concern and intentions to purchase smart home objects. Structural equation modeling is applied to data from a sample of 641 French respondents. The results confirm that altruistic, ecological variables do matter in developing intentions to purchase smart home objects. Environmental concern and perceived usefulness positively affect consumers\' intentions to purchase smart home objects.

By means of two qualitative studies and a quantitative survey with 1325 Belgian participants, early adopter consumer segments of Spirulina-enhanced food are identified (sporting individuals, vegetarians and foodies), and compared with a contrast group (life enjoyers). The motivational drivers and barriers to the adoption of eco-friendly Spirulina-enhanced food across the identified consumer segments is assessed. The results show that health consciousness and the willingness to compromise on taste are major motivational drivers of the adoption intention for sporting individuals, vegetarians and foodies. Neophobia only has a negative effect on this adoption intention for the foodies, while it does not play a role for sporting individuals and vegetarians. Neither food involvement nor environmental concern is a significant driver of Spirulina-enhanced food adoption intention.

Study 1 (n=883) analyzes the psychological mechanisms through which perceived COO competence and warmth differently affect blame attributions and evaluative responses. Study 2 (n=1,640) replicates Study 1’s findings, and it also investigates how consumer ethnocentrism, animosity toward a country, and product category characteristics moderate the hypothesized COO’s effects. COO competence leads to more favorable attitudes toward the involved company’s products. This effect increases when the company sells high-involvement or utilitarian products. COO warmth leads to more favorable attitudes toward the involved company’s products directly as well as indirectly by diminishing blame attributions. These effects increase when consumers are highly ethnocentric, or the animosity toward a foreign country is high. This paper frames the investigation of COO stereotypes in a new theoretical and empirical setting, specifically, a product-harm crisis. It demonstrates that consumers differently evaluate a potential wrongdoing company and its harmful products in a product-harm crisis based on their perceptions of a company’s COO competence and warmth.

Second, this work explores how personal values moderate the relationships between green self-identity, ecological care, moral obligation and electric car adoption intention. <br> Data were collected through a survey in a sample of 2005 car drivers residing in Belgium, Denmark and Italy. Results confirm that four value domains (i.e., self-transcendence, self-enhancement, openness-to-change and conservation) influence green self-identity, which in turn determines consumer intention to adopt electric cars both directly and indirectly via ecological care and moral obligation motivations. Furthermore, consumers who find self-transcendent and openness-to-change values important tend to express their green self-identity directly into intentions and through moral obligation evaluations. Conversely, individuals who find self-enhancement values important express their green self-identity directly into intentions, while they take the ecological and moral considerations to behave green less into account. Finally, consumers who find conservation values important translate their green self-identity less into intentions to adopt electric cars, and tend to consider less the ecological and moral aspects of consumption choices.","keywords":[{"tag":"personal values"},{"tag":"green self-identity"},{"tag":"ecological care"},{"tag":"moral obligation"},{"tag":"electric car adoption"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.ecolecon.2017.05.015"},{"id":10,"category":"article","ranking":"fnege: 3","authors":[{"name":"S.

However, there is a paucity of studies that examine how consumers evaluate and respond to brands involved in food crises and how consumers’ prejudicial views about brands may bias these responses. Following attribution theory, the current study analyzes the psychological mechanisms through which consumers form judgments about a brand’s culpability in the aftermath of a food safety scandal. Furthermore, this study assesses how the dimensions of a brand’s country-of-origin (perceived competence and perceived warmth) affect the mechanism of blame attribution. <br> A real food crisis, the 2013 European horsemeat adulteration scandal, provides the framework for an experimental study with 816 Italian consumers. The results show that perceived country-of-origin warmth diminishes consumers’ perceptions of internal locus, stability, and controllability of the food incident, thus decreasing consumers’ attributions of blame toward the faulty brand. Perceived competence increases consumers’ perceptions of the controllability of the harmful behavior which leads to higher attributions of blame. Higher blame attribution leads to lower intentions to buy the brand in the future. Furthermore, when consumers perceive the food scandal as highly severe and when they are highly ethnocentric, perceived competence diminishes consumers’ perceptions of internal locus and stability of the food incident. <br> The theoretical contribution of the study and practical implications for food brand managers are addressed.","keywords":[{"tag":"food crisis"},{"tag":"food safety scandal"},{"tag":"attribution of blame"},{"tag":"country-of-origin"},{"tag":"national stereotypes"},{"tag":"experimental research"}],"conf":null,"activities":"","city":null,"state":"","nation":null,"date":null,"link":"http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.foodqual.2016.05.015"},{"id":12,"category":"article","ranking":"cnrs: 2, fnege: 2","authors":[{"name":"C.
